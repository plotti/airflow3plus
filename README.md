# airflow3plus

### Introduction
This implementation of an airflow pipeline is used in the 3+ group as a tool to automize the generation of various reports used in the data analysis and to enrich the given data by mediapulse. As we have to generate many reports during the span of time, we are able to automize this procedure with the help of airflow, consequently we can reduce the workload because previously the reports were generated manually.<br>
This project is still in development and is frequently updated and new parts will be added in the future.
